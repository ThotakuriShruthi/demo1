            The Nissan GT-R (Japanese: ãƒ»GT-R, Nissan GT-R), is a sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, unveiled in2007.[3][4][5] It is the successor to 
             the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The GT-R is built on the PM platform, which is derived from the FM platform used in 
            the Skyline and the Nissan Z models.

            The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March2019 
            and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. 
             In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. 
            The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.
